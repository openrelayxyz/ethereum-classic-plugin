# Ethereum Classic Plugin

This project is a golang plugin designed to be run against [PluGeth](https://github.com/openrelayxyz/plugeth) nodes which allows the user to implement the [Ethereum Classic](https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth) protocol against foundation PluGeth nodes. 

The plugin can be [built and loaded](https://docs.plugeth.org/en/latest/build.html) in the same way as our other general utility [plugins](https://github.com/openrelayxyz/plugeth-plugins). 

Please [contact us](https://docs.plugeth.org/en/latest/contact.html) with any questions or ideas.
